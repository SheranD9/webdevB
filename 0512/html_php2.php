<!-- In this code, PHP_EOL is a predefined constant in PHP that represents the end-of-line character(s) for the current platform.
On Unix/Linux/Mac systems, PHP_EOL is \n.
On Windows systems, PHP_EOL is \r\n.
It is used to ensure consistent line breaks in the output, regardless of the operating system. In this case, it is being used to add a new line after each HTML tag in the output. -->
